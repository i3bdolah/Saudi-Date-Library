## Usage
The provided code demonstrates the usage of a custom C++ library for managing dates and periods. By including the "Date.h" and "Period.h" header files, the main function showcases various functionalities of the Date and Period classes.

In this example, the code initializes a Date object with a specific date and displays information such as leap year status, days, hours, minutes, and seconds in the year and month. It also illustrates operations like printing the date in different formats, generating calendars, and manipulating dates by incrementing and decrementing them.

Furthermore, the code introduces Period objects representing time spans between dates and demonstrates operations such as calculating period lengths, checking for overlaps, and counting overlapping days.
